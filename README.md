Blood Sugar Monitor
Aim: A program that monitors the blood sugar level of patients by telling them if they are at risk and should immediately link up with their healthcare provider or not. It should be noted that this program works in the form of a chat.

Input: The patient inputs their personal information, and insurance id number, the program saves this info and sends it to the healthcare provider. Then he/she inputs the value of their blood sugar level( if this value is in mg/dl, the program converts this to mmols/L). 

Processing: Based on the value input by the patient, the program outputs specific information centered on guiding and helping the patient make the next right step to medication. It should be noted that in the program there are two types of blood sugar level values;
Blood sugar level measured two hours after eating and Blood sugar level measured while fasting.
Output: If the patients’ blood sugar level falls within the normal range, the program notifies the patient.

If the patients’ blood sugar level is too high in any of the above cases ( with respect to their given values), the program advises the patient to immediately take his/her medication( self-injection of insulin or noninsulin medication).

If the patients’ blood sugar level falls within the critical zone( too low or too high), the app goes ahead to notify the patient and ask if he/she would like to link up with a doctor or healthcare provider right away via videoconferencing. This is where the role of 5g comes in. It could therefore be said that 5g would facilitate and speed up the connection of diabetes patients with their healthcare providers in extreme and/or emergency situations.
